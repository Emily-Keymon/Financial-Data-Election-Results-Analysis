# Financial Data/Election Results Analysis

---
## Financial Data Analysis
The goal of this project was to identify the candidates, vote totals, vote distribution, and overall winner of an election. Since the baseline data was provided in CSV format, Python was used to clean and process the data, as well as calculate the desired outputs.

## Tasks
  * Created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company.

  * Created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
